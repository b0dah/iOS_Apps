### Simple Weather Client

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

This application shows how to fetch and display weather data from the [Forecast](https://forecast.io/) API. This project is used to jump start several tutorials I have written on [Cocoacasts](https://cocoacasts.com/).

If you would like to build and run the project, be sure to add a valid API key to the project in **Configuration.swift**. You can create a free developer account at [Forecast](https://developer.forecast.io).
